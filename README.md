# SQL-Analysis
Sales Analysis

About the project:

On the basis of knowledge obtained from different sources I have created the sales analysis project to practice T-SQL queries.
I was able to retrieve data and perform analysis using common SQL functions.

The project presents:

-- Sales and Quantity by Product and Category; 

-- The Profit, Profit Percantage and Daily Sales by Date;

-- The Best Product with good returns for January 2021;

-- The Best Category with good returns;

-- WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD sales partition by Product ID;

-- WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD sales partition by each part of the date;

-- Annual and Monthly Revenue;

-- Next and previous year Revenue;

-- Previous month, 12 months ago and next year by month Revenue;

-- Year over Year and Month over Month growth and the % growth;

-- The number of all orders from 2021;

-- Products sold in 2022, that were more than ten thousand in Total Sales;

-- Sales avarage for each product in 2021;

-- Sales Amount by Year using sub-query;

-- Total Sales Amount using sub-query;

-- The Category and the Purchase price where Product ID = P0024 in another table;

-- Total Sales by Sales type;

-- Total Sales by Payment Mode;
